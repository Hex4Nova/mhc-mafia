Mayhem City: Mafia
=================

A social deception game within Discord, heavily inspired by *Town of Salem* and *SC2Mafia*. Find the scums among you and lynch them before it's too late, or lurk in the shadows and eliminate the majority.

### Background

*Mayhem City: Mafia* is my first proper node.js and Discord bot project, hosted on Glitch. Development began in June 2018 as only a simple game documentation/wiki bot while the game itself was manually run by human hosts, but it did not truly take off until June 2019, where the main goal became full automation due to competition and my lack of time to run manual games.

### Installation?

Although open source, *Mayhem City: Mafia*'s source was never intended to be installed and run by anyone else. As a result, many variables require a lot of manual work to set up, making it extremely user-unfriendly. This may change in the future, but there are no plans of installation instructions at the moment.

If you want to run your own Mafia bot, I suggest [La Cosa Nostra](https://github.com/Chokyotager/La-Cosa-Nostra), a more competent Mafia bot that I partially participated in.
